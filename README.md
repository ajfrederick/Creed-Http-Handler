# Online Store Customer Integration

Welcome! This is all the assets for an Unlocked package that exists in DDMN's Salesforce. It was authored by Andrew Frederick in December of 2021.

## What's In Here?

Apex classes for 3 packages two of which fulfill dependencies. The OLS Integration, the Creed Email App and the Creed Exception Handler.

There are also Salesforce metadata entities like custom fields, a record type, a permission set and more.

## Post-Install TODOs:

1) Assign permission Set
2) Create Org Wide Email Address that matches the custom label
3) Ensure Profile has page layout and record type permissions
4) Ensure the page layout assignment is correct for the record type
